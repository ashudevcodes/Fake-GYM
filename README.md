# HTML & CSS Showcase

This repository serves as a platform to demonstrate my skills in HTML and CSS. I'm actively building this project to explore and learn how GitHub Actions work for deploying static websites.

**Project Goals:**

* Refine my knowledge of HTML and CSS by creating a visually appealing and interactive website.
* Experiment with various design elements and techniques to enhance my UI/UX development capabilities.
* Gain practical experience with GitHub Actions for automated website deployment.
